### Data Analysis

[Tarkov Stats](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/48487e3f-a374-45ac-a5e1-5b3f7edfabb6/page/p_l3ac62070c)

Escape from Tarkov is a game I play with my friends. The game has six month cycles (called wipes), where at the end all progress is reset. 
Me and my friends wanted a way to see how we did that wipe and if we had improved. I created a dashboard using Looker Studio with data stored in Google sheets to show the end of wipe summary.
